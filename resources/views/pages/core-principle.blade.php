                            <p>In 2016, Poynter developed a code of principles for practitioners of fact-checking both inside and outside of journalism. Widely accepted by leading fact-check organizations and prepared following consultation with a diversity of entities across the globe, CambodiaCheck adheres to this approach. As set out by Poynter, these include:</p><ul><li><strong>“</strong><strong style="color: rgb(102, 163, 224);">A Commitment to Non-Partisanship and Fairness</strong>:<strong> </strong>We fact-check claims using the same standard for every fact check. We do not concentrate our fact-checking on any one side. We follow the same process for every fact check and let the evidence dictate our conclusions. We do not advocate or take policy positions on the issues we fact-check.</li><li><strong style="color: rgb(102, 163, 224);">A Commitment to Transparency of Sources</strong>: We want our readers to be able to verify our findings themselves. We provide all sources in enough detail that readers can replicate our work, except in cases where a source’s personal security could be compromised. In such cases, we provide as much detail as possible.</li><li><strong style="color: rgb(102, 163, 224);">A Commitment to Transparency of Funding and Organization</strong><strong>: </strong>We are transparent about our funding sources. If we accept funding from other organizations, we ensure that funders have no influence over the conclusions we reach in our reports. We detail the professional background of all key figures in our organization and explain our organizational structure and legal status. We clearly indicate a way for readers to communicate with us.</li><li><strong style="color: rgb(102, 163, 224);">A Commitment to Transparency of Methodology</strong><strong>: </strong>We explain the methodology we use to select, research, write, edit, publish and correct our fact checks. We encourage readers to send us claims to fact-check and are transparent on why and how we fact-check.</li><li><strong style="color: rgb(102, 163, 224);">A Commitment to Open and Honest Corrections</strong><strong>: </strong>We publish our corrections policy and follow it scrupulously. We correct clearly and transparently in line with our corrections policy, seeking so far as possible to ensure that readers see the corrected version.”[1]</li></ul><p>Resource: [1] Poynter. 2016.
