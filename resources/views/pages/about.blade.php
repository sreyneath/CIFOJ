                            <p>The Asia Foundation and Cambodian Institute for Cooperation and Peace (CICP) is working on a pilot program called “Countering Misinformation in Cambodia: Development of the ‘CambodiaCheck’ Digital Platform." The project is funded by the US Department of State through the US Embassy in Phnom Penh.</p><p>The initiative will create a Cambodia-specific fact checking methodology, explore placement opportunities and convene roundtables with relevant stakeholders to develop an online digital platform to mitigate existing, negative misinformation in the context of Cambodia.</p><p>Beginning as a pilot program, this initiative will initially focus on responding to empirically false information concerning Cambodia within Southeast Asia and beyond. With Cambodia assuming the ASEAN chairmanship in 2022, there is both a critical opportunity and need to counter misinformation about the country among its neighbors and external partners in general.</p><p><strong style="color: rgb(102, 163, 224);">Cambodian Institute for Cooperation and Peace (CICP)</strong></p><p>Established in 1993, CICP is Cambodia’s oldest and most well-established foreign policy think tank. Over the course of the last three decades, CICP has built an extensive network of affiliated experts domestically as well as globally, with wide-ranging expertise covering all facets of politics, economics, and foreign relations of the kingdom. With years of experience bringing together actors at the dual track levels, CICP has developed itself as a key platform for fact-based dialogue and discussion engaging all parties, in adherence to its core principles of objectivity and neutrality. CICP’s reputation – working with all actors in order to facilitate peace and development in Cambodia and the region as a whole – has placed it in a unique and useful position to work to ameliorate the problems of misinformation.&nbsp;</p><p><strong style="color: rgb(102, 163, 224);">The Asia Foundation</strong></p><p>The Asia Foundation is a nonprofit international development organization committed to improving lives across a dynamic and developing Asia.
